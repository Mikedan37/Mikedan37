# Hi, I’m Michael Danylchuk  

Electrical Engineering student & software engineer building at the intersection of **platform security, developer tools, and embedded systems**.  
I bridge low-level hardware with full-stack software — from custom PCBs and firmware to Swift-native databases and macOS/iOS apps.  

Always shipping. Always building.  

---

## What I Do  

- **Apple Platforms** — Swift, SwiftUI, AppKit, Sparkle, Xcode tooling, concurrency  
- **Systems & Embedded** — RP2040, FPGA CPUs, USB MIDI firmware, Verilog, C/ASM  
- **Developer Tools & AI** — GPT-powered PR bots, test generators, Xcode extensions  
- **Infra & Protocols** — Vapor, IMAP/SMTP sync, secure mail protocols, Raspberry Pi  

---

## Languages  

`Swift`, `Python`, `C/C++`, `Verilog`, `Assembly`, `JavaScript/TypeScript`, `HTML/CSS`
