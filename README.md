# Hi, I’m Michael Danylchuk  

Electrical Engineering student & software engineer building at the intersection of **platform security, developer tools, and embedded systems**.  
I bridge low-level hardware with full-stack software — from custom PCBs and firmware to Swift-native databases and macOS/iOS apps.  

---

## What I Do  

- **Apple Platforms** — Swift, SwiftUI, AppKit, Sparkle, Xcode tooling, concurrency  
- **Systems & Embedded** — RP2040, FPGA CPUs, USB MIDI firmware, Verilog, C/ASM  
- **Developer Tools & AI** — GPT-powered PR bots, test generators, Xcode extensions  
- **Infra & Protocols** — Vapor, IMAP/SMTP sync, secure mail protocols, Raspberry Pi  

---

## Languages  

`Swift`, `Python`, `C/C++`, `Verilog`, `Assembly`, `JavaScript/TypeScript`, `HTML/CSS`

## Highlight Projects  

- [**SecureMailClient**](https://github.com/michaeldanylchuk/SecureMailClient) – Native encrypted mail client with burn-after-read, IMAP/SMTP integration, and a Vapor backend.  
- [**BlazeDB**](https://github.com/michaeldanylchuk/BlazeDB) – Swift-native database with schemas, indexes, and a query DSL.  
- [**Blazel**](https://github.com/michaeldanylchuk/Blazel) – A Swift DSL + runtime interpreter enabling live updates, feature flags, and A/B testing.  
- [**DesktopOrganizer**](https://github.com/michaeldanylchuk/DesktopOrganizer) – macOS menu extra with AI-powered file classification, timeline snapshots, and AppleScript automation.  
- [**PiPhoneOS**](https://github.com/michaeldanylchuk/PiPhoneOS) – Raspberry Pi–based open mobile OS with touchscreen UI, battery management, and AT command integration.  
- [**MIDI Keyboard & Synth**](https://github.com/michaeldanylchuk/SJSUSeniorDesign_MIDIKeyboard_SoundEngine) – Senior design project: USB-powered MIDI keyboard with custom PCB + Python/C synth + driver.
